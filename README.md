# nasdaq-100-simple-ml-strategy

Aiming to answer the question: Is it possible to outperform DCA on the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) index with a simple data science analysis?

We use simple tools, such as regressions & common technical analysis metrics, to come up with a model that provides a small outperformance vs a standard DCA strategy. Backtesting on ~35yrs of investing shows a ~3% outperfomance on the entire period. This is obviously small and mainly due to our (very) simplistic approach, but we lay some groundwork on eventually building this into a better system.
